  <h1>HTML,CSS and DOM</h1>
  <p>Html lays out the structure and the basic template of the website. Css gives the user the ability to 
      design the websites, layout, style and colourscheme with much more detail than simply using html does. Dom is a useful 
      framework for understanding the structure of the website and giving the user a clean, simplified way of analyzing and 
      tweaking the website.
  </p>
  <h2>Boxifying design?</h2>
  <p>Boxifying design refers to sketching out in some form or another, the lay out of the webpage with an emphasis on
      giving every aspect its own specific box. This is how websites are designed, with a series of unique boxes, positioned
      and designed in ways that give the user the most accesible and useful experience.
  </p>
  <h3>The box model</h3>
  <p>the box model is as I have explained above, a method for wrapping all html elements in boxes. This then allows
      you to make changes with things such as box width margin width etc
