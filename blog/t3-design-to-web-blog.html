      <h1>Design process</h1>
      <h2>whats a responsive website and why responsiveness is imporportant?</h2>
      <p>a responsive website is a website that is easy for all users to interface
          with and can be used efficiently on a number of different devices with different 
          screen sizes, e.g tablets, smartphones.This is important because the vast majority
          of people interface with the internet on multiple devices.
      </p>
      <h2>Whats mobile first design and why is it important?</h2>
 
      <p>mobile first design is the idea that you should design  websites and applications
           beginning with the mobile version and then tweaking and improving them for the laptop afterwards.
           this is important as mobile internet usage has recently surpassed laptop internet usage.
      </p>
      <h2>What frameworks are and there pros and cons?</h2>
      <p>Frameworks are pieces of software that can be utilised by anyone while coding and create a quick  and easy way
          for programmers to employ different styles and tweaks to there work without having to create there own code from scratch.
          This is important as it allows people to create responsive websites faster than otherwise. The downsides are they
           are not created specifically for that projects so they may not be as optimal in the eyes of the consumer as they
            may have been able to be.

      <h2>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h2>
      <p>a wireframe is a outline of the website/app that gives us a guideline of what it should look like on multiple 
          devices. We use it because it gives us a good platform to understand how the website should look and feel like
          on different devices and screen sizes, which allows us to work towards the end product more efficiently.
