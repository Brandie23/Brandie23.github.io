      My impressions of EDA so far are positive and encouraging.

     The culture seems very inviting and inclusive, I believe this will be very useful in fostering an open and welcoming environment which will allow the students to excel.

    My opinion of EDA has not changed since I have begun. I am excited to participate in an environment like this
